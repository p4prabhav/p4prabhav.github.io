								Hello,
								<br>
								I scored overall 7.5 bands in reading, writing, speaking, and listening in IELTS. I recently got a certificate for high distinction in Bioscience-I in first semester. I am a warm-hearted person, with professional communication skills and l display sensitivity and empathy while communicating. I am good at solving problems and can handle any stressful situation confidently. I am punctual and like to finish work on time. I am a dedicated team-worker and respect everyone’s rights. I am reliable and understand the necessity of maintaining confidentiality as a nurse. Currently, I am working as an Assistant in Nursing (AIN) with an agency and I work in different nursing homes and hospitals. My long-term goal is to become a registered nurse after completing my bachelor’s degree in nursing. Once I become a registered nurse, I will abide by all the codes and conducts of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia and be professional in my practice. According to the standard three of code of conduct for nurses are required to respect the privacy of the patient and maintain the confidentiality of their personal information (NMBA, 2018). Hence, I will always request informed consent from the patient before sharing their personal information with anyone as this will result in developing therapeutic relationship with patients.

									On my shift last week, where I was working as an AIN, I had to sponge a patient who was in palliative care due to a brain tumour. My co-worker had gone to find a lifter, whilst I washed the patient’s face. Her eyes were open and, as I was told that she doesn’t respond much, I assumed that this was normal for her. I closed her eyes to clean them properly, but she just did not open her eyes after that. When I noticed no chest movements and no pulse rate, I immediately told the registered nurse who came and checked the patient’s vital signs. The Registered Nurse then declared that the patient had died. As this was the first time that I encountered death in my life, I felt nervous and scared. I was upset because I felt that the patient died in my care and I could have saved her. However, after speaking with the family I felt better because I could share their grief and console them. AIN is supposed to ensure patient safety and take care of all the needs of the patient. While providing end-of-life care we need to acknowledge the patient’s beliefs and perform ceremonies according to their customs. After experiencing this personally I realised that how important it is to know the person to provide Quality Care. Also, I understood the importance of being prepared for unplanned events like death because it is important to control emotional responses in such situations. If I had read more about the end-of-life care and how to perform different ceremonies according to different religions and ethnicities at the death time I could have handled it more independently and confidently. However, I am sure I will be able to deal with any such experience more appropriately in the future, I will stay calm and emotionally stable. Rather than getting frightened I will immediately inform the team leader and the registered nurse. I will be empathetic towards the family members and give them emotional support. I will respect the rituals that the family will follow and pay my contribution too.
